# Ghost Pong

The result of me experimenting with networking in Game Maker Studio 2 for a few weeks. I like to look back at the evolution of things like this in GIF form. Have a look!

- The 'hello world' of networking applications is to see simultanious movement on two windows. I remember being thrilled here.

- Getting physics synced was another milestone. I quickly learned that it was best to handle almost all game movement on the server. Client 2 is out of frame here, but you can see the server (purple) handling the physics of the ball and sending that data to each client.

Overall this experiment was extremely fun and challenging and taught me a LOT abut networking in games. Especially sockets and how to optimize packets of data by using buffers.
